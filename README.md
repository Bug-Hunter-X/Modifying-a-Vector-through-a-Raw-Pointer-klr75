# Modifying a Vector through a Raw Pointer in Rust
This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust when working with raw pointers and vectors. The code attempts to modify a vector's elements via a raw pointer. This often leads to unexpected behavior and potential crashes. The solution showcases how to correctly handle vector modifications using safe Rust methods. 

## Running the Code

To run this example, clone this repository and then run `cargo run` within the project directory. The output will show the changes done by both the erroneous and the corrected approaches.
